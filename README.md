# reinforcement-learning
Demonstrations, examples, and tutorials for reinforcement learning, including policy gradient and k-armed bandit problems.

## k-armed-bandit.py and k-armed-bandit-simple.py

`k-armed-bandit.py` compares the average reward for epsilon-greedy k-armed bandit algorithms over some number of iterations. k-armed-bandit-simple will perform this analysis, but only for a single value of epsilon.

## minimax.py and a-b-pruning.py

python implementations of the minimax and alpha-beta pruning minimax algorithms for tic-tac-toe in Python.
